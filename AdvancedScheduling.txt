1.)	The process needs 5 swaps to complete the task

2.)	A: 142,5
	B: 102,5
	The scheduler would first take process B because the estimated time is lower than at process A

3.)	CPU-bound processes are processes that work in the background and have no user interraction(virus-scanner)
	I/O-bound processes have a high user interraction like a webbrowser

	CPU-bound processes need more quanta to be faster with the work and I/O-bound processes need a higher priority to make the user interraction better

4.)	35/50 + 20/100 + 10/200 + x/250 = 1	->	x = 12,5msec
